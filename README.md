## Run Ave locally
To run Ave locally, you need `nodejs` and `npm`. You will also need to have typescript installed globally.

1. clone the repo 
```
git clone https://github.com/srijan-paul/AveTS
```
2.  install dependencies

```
npm install
```

3. Compile the typescript code to JS.

```
tsc
```

4. Now all the JS files should be written to a new directory `./build`
To run the tests on lexer, do:

```
npm run lextest
```

To run the parser tests:

```
npm run parsetest
```

The codegen hasn't been implemented yet, so there is not much to do other than inspect the AST from logs on the terminal.
The backend is being worked upon.
